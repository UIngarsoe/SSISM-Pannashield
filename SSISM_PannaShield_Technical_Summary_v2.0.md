Abstract
Operationalizing Ethics in AI for Atrocity Accountability

The *SS'ISM Paññā Shield v2.0* is an open-source Artificial Intelligence framework designed to operationalize the **Veto Cost Hypothesis** — the measurable link between UN Security Council vetoes and civilian harm.  
It transforms passive data into **Actionable Output (A′)** using an ethical architecture derived from Buddhist epistemology (*Sīla, Samādhi, Paññā*).  

This version fuses real-time satellite, OSINT, and political data to provide verifiable evidence where traditional channels fail.  
Each computation step follows ethical constraints, ensuring AI acts with wisdom and accountability — *not automation without conscience.*

 System Overview
| Core Module | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Atrocity Index (H)** | Fuses satellite, OSINT, and veto event data to quantify the real-time humanitarian cost of vetoes. |
| **Paññā Fusion Engine** | Integrates foresight (V14), social reciprocity (V15), and psywar context (V16) to calculate a *Fused Likelihood (Lₓ)* of intervention. |
| **Ethical Constraint Layer** | Applies *Sīla–Samādhi–Paññā* weighting to ensure moral decision boundaries. |
| **Actionable Output (A′)** | Converts ethical data into executable recommendations, not mere reports. |

Key Equation Example
```python
L_fused = exp[ (W_Foresight * ln V14) + (W_Social * ln V15) + (W_Context * ln V16) - B_Karmic ]
